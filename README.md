# 🧪 Software Testing 

Welcome to the **Software Testing** project!  
This guide will help you understand the basics of software testing, its importance, and how to get started.


## 🚀 What is Software Testing?

Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system does what it is supposed to do.  
It helps identify bugs, errors, or missing requirements compared to the actual requirements.

> **“Testing is not just about finding bugs, it’s about building confidence in your product.”**


## 🧠 Why is Software Testing Important?

- Ensures software quality and reliability
- Detects bugs before users do
- Saves time and cost in the long run
- Improves user satisfaction


## 🛠️ Types of Software Testing

- **Unit Testing:** Test individual components or functions.
- **Integration Testing:** Test how different modules work together.
- **System Testing:** Test the complete system as a whole.
- **Acceptance Testing:** Test if the system meets business requirements.


## 👥 Manual vs Automated Testing

| Manual Testing                | Automated Testing                |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Performed by humans           | Performed by scripts/tools       |
| Good for exploratory testing  | Good for repetitive tasks        |
| Slower, but flexible          | Faster, but needs setup          |


## 📝 How to Start Testing

1. **Understand Requirements:** Know what the software should do.
2. **Write Test Cases:** Create step-by-step scenarios to test features.
3. **Execute Tests:** Run the software and follow your test cases.
4. **Report Bugs:** Document any issues or unexpected behavior.
5. **Retest:** Verify that bugs are fixed.
